Main features
-------------
Flower Datasets library supports:

- **downloading datasets** - choose the dataset from Hugging Face's ``dataset``
- **partitioning datasets** - customize the partitioning scheme
- **creating centralized datasets** - leave parts of the dataset unpartitioned (e.g. for centralized evaluation)

Thanks to using Hugging Face's ``datasets`` used under the hood, Flower Datasets integrates with the following popular formats/frameworks:

- Hugging Face
- PyTorch
- TensorFlow
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Jax
- Arrow

Install
-------

The simplest install is

.. code-block:: bash

  python -m pip install flwr-datasets

If you plan to use the image datasets

.. code-block:: bash

  python -m pip install flwr-datasets[vision]

If you plan to use the audio datasets

.. code-block:: bash

  python -m pip install flwr-datasets[audio]
